## Round Up notification frequency:
* I don't think I have time to check the notification at the moment of spending. Most likely, I would be on my way to somewhere, 
I might be in metro. I think I will be annoyed if I get notification everytime.
* I wish to set the time, frequency of notification. 

## Round Up amount:
* When I choose the amount I'd like to round up, I wish it tells me what kind of impact I will be making. As I make donation, 
it tells me "this amount could do this much" and it can help me to decide how much I should choose.
(60 cent could help this much. $2 could help this much, for example)

## Charities 
* Q. Who choses these charities for me? (answer : you can choose it on your own in the setting)
* Q. How about it lets me add more charities in the list here? (in the screen where user choses portion for each charity)
